## Plotting Data

In this section we examine some of the trends from the recent census results.

```{r Census 2022, echo=FALSE}
#Create plot of average household size by Greater Dublin Area local authority
source("R/census_2022_derive_vars.R")
plot(hsize_2022)
```

The figure shows that household size has remained almost unchanged since 2016. The trend between 2011 and 2016 of an increasing household size has stopped.

```{r Census 2022 Mortgage, echo=FALSE}
#Create plot of average household size by Greater Dublin Area local authority
source("R/cso_2022_mortgage_change.R")
plot(p_mort0222)
```
