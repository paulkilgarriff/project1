#macroprudential - identify areas that have weak demand
#use ratio of construction costs to market price as a proxy for market strength
#Examine LTV levels by area - is there any spatial patterns in the data
#Are there clusters of high or low LTV rates
#Cross examine these clusters with ratio of housing demand
#High LTV in areas wit strong demand carries less risk than high LTV in areas

#reduce risk with self-builds, building defects, control over quality - more risk
#construction cost limits - additional limits on price per m2 of construction
#construction costs often underestimated.
